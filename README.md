# Pascal.php

## What is it ?

This was our first project in PHP, we had to reproduct the same behaviour and aspect from [this page](https://i.neilrichter.com/aw2u0.mp4)
It represents **[Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle)** Each cell of the table that is not the first or the last of a row, has for value the total of the two cells above it. 

## I wanna see it in live.
